If you like this software, put a star!

If you found some issues, don't know how to use this builder, simply post a issue. I would be happy to help you!

## Version problems

>API Version >= 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Everything will be broken since DBBuilder 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.

Only version >= 2.0.0-BETA of DBBuilder will be compatible.
The database file is ```kmbeta_db.json```.

Database file is not required. 

Developers can choose to access the database directly from KMB, via the ```KmbETA-WebDB``` server or offline database.

>API Version <= 0.1.1-BETA

Only version >= 1.5.2-BETA of DBBuilder will be compatible.
The database file is ```bus_stopdb.properties```.

I would like to clarify this point.
